The Telco customer churn case study for this tutorial (as well as the customer churn dataset) came from <https://github.com/sol-eng/tensorflow-w-r/blob/main/workflow/tensorflow-drake.Rmd> (by RStudio) and <https://github.com/IBM/telco-customer-churn-on-icp4d> (by IBM). Both repos were released under the Apache License Version 2.0 and copyright remains with their respective companies. This includes the user-defined functions in `1-functions.Rmd` and appearances of these functions everywhere else in this repository. Credit also goes to Matt Dancho for his RStudio AI Blog post at <https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2018-01-11-keras-customer-churn/>, which helps explain the motivation and usage of these functions.
